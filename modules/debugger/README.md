_This module only exists because I want better debug information for our
modules, if you don't want it, please don't use this module â€” its not intended
to be used for normal module development scenarios and/or small modules. If your
module already works fine and you never wanted a solution that logs things for
you, then this module is not for you!_

_If you always goes through a hard process to spot problems, constantly wanting
more info to fix errors, then you could benefit from using_ **Debugger**.
